# Hackathon-UWBC
- Developed a Web App for users to determine new food hub locations by calculated area demand size and location score with the constraint optimization model to optimize selections of new food hub location
- Converted sets of address into position points using Geoapify and calculated distances between food resources and demands with Java Spring Framework; generated location scores to reflect the best locations for new food hubs
- Complete functions are yet to complete due to limitation of time
